# Apple Pay Technology
Apple, The tech giant leading inovation in usability, quality, and connectivit products.
Founded by Steve Jobs in 1976 in Los Altos California who evolved the idea of the personal computer, cell phone, watch, payments and much more. Constantly innovating their design to best fit the user experience of connectivity and workflow the tech giant has been a leading foot in the way we interact on a daily basis. 
One major turning point in technology offered by Apple is their 'Apple Pay' technology, this technology allows users to seamlessly pay without the need of their physical card. Utilizing features built into their products such as Near field communication, this techonolgy is commonly used to connect other products such as Air pods and Apple tv. While utilizing thier connectivity Apple also offers security through thier embedded secure element which is user authorized through TouchId, FaceId, or Userset passcode.

#### How is this technology being adopted?
Through competition from companies such as samsung and google devloping their own form of Apple pay the users ability to seamlessly have access to their payment methods is beginning to create a much more efficient user experience in finance. Users are able to quickly checkout from online orders, pay at the register without the need of having their card directly on them or the need to type in a pin, all while maintaining their privacy of data. 

#### How are users protected?
"Apple Transmits, but Does Not Store Your Payment Information

In order to securely transmit your payment information within apps, websites, and Business Chat, it is sent to Apple in encrypted form, where it is briefly decrypted and re-encrypted with a merchant-specific key, so that only the merchant, the developer, or their payment processor can decrypt your payment information. When you make a payment on a Mac to which a card cannot be added, the Mac and the authorizing device communicate over an encrypted channel via Apple servers. Apple does not retain any of this information in a form that personally identifies you."

#### What is the next step for this product?
With the world quickly moving torwards a new online era where everything from art to realestate are being created bought and sold at the speed of light the need for quick payment methods which give the user ease of use are becoming essential. The need for paper payment methods are becoming dilute. While we spend more and more time online and on our devices it is only inevitable that finance follows the footsteps of the world. 
We may not be there yet but the need for banks are slowly being replaced by cryptocurrency companies and peer to peer lending. The need for technology to access this at a blink of an eye is beyond neccesarry. 

#### Merchant Fees and Difficulties
Although Apple pay is very user friendly it is not commonly offered in your smaller retail stores as their are many fees associated with setup and use on top of the fees the companies already have to pay torwards credit and debit card use to companies such as Visa and Mastercard. 

Here is a break down of the fees from companies who support Apple pay:
| Purchase of NFS System  | < $100  |
| ------------------------|:-------------:|
| Software Upgrades     | $0-Hourly wage of technitian    |
| Employee Training     | Hourly wage     |
| Swipe Fees      | 2-4% per Transaction     |

*These issues have been addressed by card vendors and already reduced

#### Recommendations
To further this product I beleive Apple should allow the use of crytpo currencies as a payment option as companies such as crypto.com and many others are allowing users to do so. This transiton will begin to mend the online world to the every day world as we know it. 

Creating a loan system through Apple Pay further than a credit card, with the development of peer to peer lending I feel it is essential to have the capabilites to take the loan at the click of a button to keep up with the pace of the world, In a dire situation in which you need a few hundred dollars to make it home safely? Quickly preform such action on your Apple device.
